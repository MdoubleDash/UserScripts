## Earlier Contributions
As of the creation of this file on 2020-01-01, all future contributions to this repository are licensed under the MIT License.

Unfortunately, there was no actual license for contributions prior to 2020-01-01. As such, in order for the code that existed prior to that to have a license, each earlier contributor must individually agree to license their existing contributions under the MIT License.

As a result, the license for the code in this repository is complex. If you intend to use the code in this repository, you will need to verify for yourself that the portions of code you desire to use are covered under the MIT License. You can check if the contribution containing original version of the code you desire to use was made on or after the creation of this file (2020-01-01), or if the author of the contribution has added their name below.

Prior contributors can indicate their agreement to license their existing contributions under the MIT License by editing this file with the GitHub account from which the prior contribution(s) were made and adding their GitHub username below.

Individuals who have no contributions prior to 2020-01-01 do not need to add their name to the list below, as they agreed to grant a license under the above MIT License at the time they made the contribution.

I license all of my contributions to this repository under the MIT License:
